      This started out as a simple project. I wanted to display the latest photos
      from my instagram feed on my blog using a simple JavaScript embed. I found 
      a nice solution in the <a href="http://potomak.github.com/jquery-instagram/">jquery-instagram
      library</a>.

      I also found 
      <a href="http://statigr.am">Statigram</a>
      which has a ton of features.

      Still, I decided to make this because I wanted something stripped down and
      that's a self-contained, simple solution. Plus, it was a fun 24 hour hack.
